# Arduino-traffic-light-system
We all know about Arduino. It is one of the most popular open source microcontroller board which is highly useful for doing projects. This Arduino based 3-Way Traffic Light Controller is a simple Arduino project which is useful to understand the working of traffic lights which we see around us. We have covered a simpler version of traffic lights in this traffic light circuit.


<b>How to work the project:</b>


The code for this Arduino Traffic Light Controller Project is simple and can be easily understood. Here we have demonstrated Traffic lights for the 3 ways road and the code glows LEDâ€™s on all the three sides in a particular sequence, in which the actual Traffic Lights works. Like, at a time, there will be two Red signals on any of the two sides and one Green light on the remaining side. And yellow light will also glow, for 1 second each time, in between transition from Red to Green, means first red-light glows for 5 second then yellow light glows for 1 second and then finally green light will be turned on.
